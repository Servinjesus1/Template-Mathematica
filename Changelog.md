- Wrong shortcut for code/text
- Added mono fonts for LM, look pretty
- Fixed equation counter resetting on sub/subsubsections. Doesn't make sense since only section numbers show up in these labels
- Fix page indexing ii of 5, etc.
- Updated font sizes for printout. Many cells derive fontsize directly from TraditionalForm and StandardForm
